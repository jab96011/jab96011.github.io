  # Jaebin Lee


  **Hello!** I am an undergraduate student at Seoul National University, majoring in **Landscape Architecture** and **Physics**. As a research assistant, I worked on improving simulations for 2D materials to validate experimental results. In the future, I hope to investigate **complex systems** related to urban green infrastructure and ecosystems.

## Hello, 안녕하세요!
**“Is there any connection between physics and landscape architecture?”**
I am Jaebin Lee, pursuing an unprecedented double major in these two fields. While I was less drawn to landscape design itself, I eventually found myself taking on physics as a second major. When I applied for a position as an undergraduate research assistant—driven by my genuine interest in physics—a professor once posed that very question to me. Even if the connection is not obvious, I believe that the broad perspective gained from studying both disciplines will one day prove valuable in my journey.

**"물리와 조경이 관계가 있나요?"** 전무후무한 복수전공을 하고 있는 이재빈이라고 합니다. 조경 디자인보다는 다른 것에 관심이 많았던 저는, 어쩌다 보니 물리를 복수전공하게 되었습니다. 물리가 재밌어 학부연구생을 지원할 때, 교수님께서 저리 말씀을 하셨네요. 연관없어 보일지라도, 두 개의 전공을 통해 얻은 넓은 시야가 저의 앞길에 언젠가 도움이 될 것이라는 믿음을 가지고 살아가고 있습니다.
